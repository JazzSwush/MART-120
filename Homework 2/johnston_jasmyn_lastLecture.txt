The part that affected me the most is when he was talking about his experiences and childhood dreams. Randy said, “experience is what you get when you didn’t get what you want.” There were times when he did not fulfill his dream fully and got to at least experience it. Changing the alteration of his dream instead of being like Captain Kirk, he got to meet him instead. Even being an imagineer, he got to experience it instead of working their full time. Many of these experiences came with brick walls. The way he describes brick walls are “brick walls are there for a reason: they let us prove how badly we want things.”. Brick walls aren’t necessarily physical brick walls, but metaphoric challenges that come across opportunity. Randy gave a lot of life lessons and input on what we can do to help others. Especially, brick walls show up, it shows your dedication to either push through to the end or end up being stopped by the brick wall.  Brick walls are like life lessons as well; they help gain these experiences along the way. Listening to his childhood dreams, showed how he lived his life. Randy said, “it’s about how you lead your life.” How am I going to lead my life? This question echoed in my head as the video started to end. Since his time was shorter than mines, he was able to live a full life despite having cancer. I am just beginning a new chapter by transferring to this college. Let’s see where my life takes me in game design.
