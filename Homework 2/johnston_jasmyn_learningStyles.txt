I think different learning styles affect how each person learns. I am very much a visual learner; I need illustrations or pictures to help me remember things better. Not everyone is the same as how they learn. Whichever way is best for people, is what they should use to learn. If you stick to a learning style that does not suit your taste, then you won’t learn as effectively. It would take longer to grasp something, if it is done differently on how you learn. I watch videos on how to do things, and I can remember almost everything about what to do. But if it was just an audio recording, I would have to listen to it repeatedly until I could get it right. The process takes longer than the usual learning style. There are learning curves to other methods and styles, choose something that fits your way. But you don’t always have to stick to that style as well. You can either use the same style or change it up. Whatever is best for your learning and comprehension is all up to the learner. Like I can’t learn when there are just words on paper, I need something visual to aid my comprehension.
